I had a very long session today, spending over 100,000 coins on rescues across various regions, and made lots of progress in rescuing new Ice Age animals after unlocking the Ice Age time machine last week.

## 08

**08**

I had an extremely long session today, originally I wasn't going to play at all, other than to wake my animals up. Today, I did rescues across various regions to complete space requests. I also maxed out my first mythical animal (Grython) and along with it, maxed out the savannah. I dealt with a lot of annoying ads again today. I eventually stopped doing all ReQuests and did rescues for a bit, then went back and spent some of my final money on more Space ReQuests. I didn't spend all my money, as I had been playing too long and needed to quit. - 2021 September 29th

## 09

I had an extremely long session today, originally I wasn't going to play at all, other than to wake my animals up, just like last week. Today, I did rescues across various regions to complete many space requests. I threw several disco parties due to getting multiple bronze, silver, and gold trophies. I dealt with a lot of annoying ads again today. I didn't spend all my money, as I had been playing too long and needed to quit. I still had over 50000 coins when quitting, as it was almost 2:00 pm. The amount of images and its ratio file size gave me joy. - 2021 October 6th

I had an extremely long session today. I am unable to efficiently spend all my coins, but I tried today. Today, I got my first diamond trophy, made very little disco bux, unlocked the Mars rocket, did some rescues on the moon, then spent the rest of my session doing rescues on Mars. I am now capable of unlocking the city, so I plan to semi-save up for it now. - 2021 October 13th

I had an extremely long session today. I did collection and woke up the animals, then I did a series of rescues in the city until I ran out of money.

I want to try and get to that point eventually (1800+ coins per minute) I then did some space requests, wrapped up and quit. I earned tons of Disco Bux today. Also during one of my rescues, I ended up losing over 17000 coins for nothing, as watching an ad crashed the game, and I wasn't able to rescue any of the 3 animals in that rescue. - 2021 November 24th
