# 2023, Friday, April 14th - Didn't play

I didn't play Disco Zoo today. Today was not a scheduled day to play.

## Why?

Due to a discovery on Saturday, 2020 October 24th about how much time all games together take up, and how little time it leaves me, I had to make a schedule change for gaming, splitting all 25 games I play across a 7 day period, instead of all in 1 day.

## When will you come back?

I won't be playing this game again until the new time slot, which is Wednesday. I will be playing again on Wednesday, 2023, April 19th.

### Possible schedule change

I am considering moving this game from Wednesday to Tuesday (swapping Bit City from Tuesday to Wednesday) this decision is ongoing. If this decision goes through, my next timeslot will be Tuesday, meaning I will be playing again on 2023, Tuesday, April 18th.
